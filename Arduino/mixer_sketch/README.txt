A substantially more straight-forward version of this Arduino sketch could be used with a rotary encoder which functions 
better than mine. I believe the lack of capacitors on the board of my encoder, or potentially a problem with the internal
contacts, was causing my inputs not to be registered due to noise. I had to do a great deal of tweaking to get around this.
I may upload the simplified version of the sketch in the future.
