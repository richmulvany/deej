Attached are the STL files for the 3D printed parts I used in this project. There are a couple of caveats to note, which
mean I would suggest designing your own models if you were to want to mimic my volume mixer:

  -- I used a resin printer, where most people will be using filament. I also ran into some tolerance problems with my prints
    probably due to overnight temperature changes while printing, and so had to do some sanding (and my case is slightly warped)
  -- I used superglue to attach my board to the usb-c slot, and to attach the front of the case to the case, where most people 
    print in screw holes. Superglue is just what I happened to have to I went with it.
  -- You will need long and skinny fingers like mine to get the board to line up with the usb-c slot, I think I would modify
    the model if I were to print it again to have a side of the case attached to the face, which would slide in to the case.
